# Git and GitHub Testing Project

This is a simple project created to learn and practice the basic concepts of **Git** and **GitHub**. The main goal is to explore essential Git commands and understand how local and remote repositories work.

## Project Objectives

- Get familiar with basic Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and more.
- Learn how to create and manage repositories on GitHub.
- Test the basic workflow:
- Commit creation.
- Synchronization between local and remote repositories.
- Conflict resolution.
- Understand how to work with branches and pull requests.

## Learnings

Throughout this project, I am focusing on:
- How to use Git efficiently in the terminal.
- How to interact with GitHub to host and share projects.
- Best practices for versioning and collaboration.
